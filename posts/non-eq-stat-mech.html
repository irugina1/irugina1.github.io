<h1>Non-equilibrium stat mech</h1>
<h2>Setup</h2>
Consider both microscopic and macroscopic settings. In either case we look at:
<ul>
<li>system</li>
<li>heat bath</li>
<li>work done on the system - given by a generalized force $W = \int F d\lambda$ </li>
</ul>

<h2>Review</h2>

<h3>First Law</h3>

\begin{equation*}
\Delta U = W + Q
\end{equation*}
where
<ul>
<li>$W$ is work done on the system</li>
<li>$Q$ is heat absorbed by system</li>
</ul>



<h3>Second Law</h3>
<h6>Clausius</h6> 
There exists a state function $S$ such that
\begin{equation*}
\int_A^B \frac{dQ}{T} \leq \Delta S = S_B - S_A
\end{equation*}
For systems with a single heat reservoir Clausius and the first law say
\begin{equation*}
W \geq \Delta F = F_B - F_A,
\end{equation*}
where $F$ is the free energy $F = U - TS$.
<h6>Cyclic Process - Thomson</h6>
\begin{equation*}
W_{cyc} \geq 0 \implies Q_{cyc} \leq 0
\end{equation*}

<h3>Conjuge processes</h3>
Forward process $A \rightarrow B$ and reverse $B \rightarrow A$ performed by varying work parameters $\lambda^F_t$ and $\lambda^R_t$ with $0 \leq t \leq T$ such that $\lambda_t^R = \lambda_{T-t}^F$.

<h6>Macroscopic Systems</h6>
\begin{equation*}
W^F \geq F_B - F_A = \Delta F
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
W^R \geq F_A - F_B = -\Delta F
\end{equation*}
which implies $-W^R \leq \Delta F \leq W^F$.

<h6>Microscopic Systems</h6>
Discussion above, motivated by 2nd law for macroscopic systems, now holds only in expectation: $- \langle W^R \rangle \leq \Delta F \leq \langle W^F \rangle$.

<h2>Thomson Law from Microscopic Principles</h2>
Consider isolated cyclic process and microstate described by 
\begin{equation*}
x = (q, p) = (r_1, \dots r_m, p_1, \dots, p_m) 
\end{equation*}
with Hamiltonian $H = H(x, \lambda)$ which gives $\dot{q} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p}$ and $\dot{p} = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q}$. These equations of motion describe evolution from $x_0$ to $x_T$.

<h6>Liouville Theorem</h6>
Phase space volume is conserved. Look at Jacobian of transformation
\begin{equation*}
\left| \frac{\partial x_T}{\partial x_0} \right| = \text{det} \left(  \frac{\partial x_{T,i}}{\partial x_{0,j}}\right) = \exp \left( \int_0^T \nabla \dot{x} dt \right) = 1
\end{equation*}
because $\nabla \dot{x} = \sum_i \left[ \frac{\partial}{\partial q_i} \dot{q_i} +  \frac{\partial}{\partial p_i} \dot{p_i}\right] = 0$

<h6>Implications on 2nd law</h6>
Phase space volume conservation implies $W > 0$ for some initial conditions and $W < 0$ for others. The 2nd law is interpreted statistically 
\begin{equation*}
\langle W \rangle = \int dx_0 f_A(x_0) \left[ H_A(x_T(x_0)) - H_A(x_0) \right] \geq 0
\end{equation*}
where $f_A$ is some distribution of initial conditions describing the initial equilibrium state. Three candidates for this distribution are the microcanonical, canonical, and macrocanonical ensembles:
<ul>
<li>$f_A^{\mu}(x) = \frac{1}{\Sigma}\delta \left[ U_A - H_A(x) \right]$</li>
<li>$f_A^{c}(x) = \frac{1}{Z}\exp \left[ -\beta H_A(x) \right]$</li>
<li>$f_A^{M}(x) = \frac{1}{\Omega}\theta \left[ U_A - H_A(x) \right]$</li>
</ul>
$\langle W \rangle > 0$ holds for the canonical and macrocanonical ensembles, but not the microcanonical one. That's ok, doesn't break 2nd law.

<h6>Proof for canonical ensemble</h6>
Imagine we move from $x$ to $y(x)$ in phase space and look at:
\begin{equation*}
\langle \exp(-\beta W) \rangle = \int dx \frac{1}{Z} e^{-\beta H_A(x)} e^{-\beta [H_A(y(x)) - H_A(x) ]} = \frac{1}{Z} \int dx e^{-\beta H_A(y(x))} 
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
\langle \exp(-\beta W) \rangle =  \frac{1}{Z} \int dy e^{-\beta H_A(y)} = 1
\end{equation*}
where we used Liouville Theorem for the change of variable.
From Jensen this shows that $\langle W \rangle \geq 0$ and on average the energy increases under cyclic Hamiltonian evolution.

<h2>Nonequilibrium work and fluctuation relations</h2>
We saw work $W$ is a stochastic variable and second law holds in expectation $\langle W \rangle \geq \Delta F$. Can we say more about fluctuations in work? Three important statements.
<h6>Jarzynski equality</h6>
\begin{equation*}
\langle e^{-\beta W} \rangle= e^{-\beta \Delta F}
\end{equation*}

This is an equality that holds for irreversible microscopic processes! It also implies the inequality above $\langle W \rangle \geq \Delta F$. Moreover, it says fluctuations decay exponentially $P (W \leq \Delta F - n \cdot \beta^{-1}) \leq e^{-n}$. This shows violations of 2nd law are extremely rare and explains why we don't observe them macroscopically.

<h6>Crooks fluctuation theorem</h6>
Relates distributions over work $W$ during forward and reverse processes:
\begin{equation*}
\frac{p_F(W)}{p_R(-W)} = e^{\beta(W-\Delta F)}
\end{equation*}
Powerful statement because it relates two distributions which can take various forms based on how we perturb the system and yet this always holds. Also: distributions always crosss at $W = \Delta F$.


<h6>Hummer and Szabo</h6>

\begin{equation*}
\langle \delta(x-x_t)e^{-\beta w_t} \rangle = \frac{1}{Z_A} e^{-\beta H(x, \lambda_t)}
\end{equation*}
<ul>
<li>$x$ is independent variable - any point in phase space</li>
<li>$w_t$ work performed up to $x_t$</li>
<li>RHS is partition except for not properly normalized</li>
</ul>
Discussion: LHS is ensemble of trajectories in phase space. Averaging over that exponential (time-dependent weight) you can reconstruct equilibrium states along path. Consequence of Feynman-Kac theorem.
